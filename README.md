#useful CSS bits
##Intro:
This is not meant to be a framework, it was purely created to be a reference and maybe get some collaboration on some useful css trickery

##Collaboration:
Feel free to make a pull request, but there are a few rules (boo!)

1. CSS only
2. Don't use classes or ids, target elements by their tag name
3. use one element only
4. Follow the comment guidelines*
5. Please keep it as simple as possible, do not include css for webkit/firefox/ie support, it is the peron using the css to take care of compatibility, feel free to add all the information to a codepen example if you would like 
6. If the css is not created by you - provide a link to the original creators blog/site etc in the comments above your contribution
7. You may add a file, but stick to the convention of elementname.css
8. only add the most basic css for the effect to work, avoid using specific fonts, colours etc, just the basic idea is what I'm after 
9. suggestions on someones CSS will only be accepted through the github issues channel, so that you can defend your honour 
10. please for the love of everything that is worth living for, format your CSS reasonably - use proper indentation - keep it tidy
11. Feel free to call me out if I break the rules myself
12. I might add more rules at any point - and apologies for all the rules, They are here to make pull requests smoother
13. Read the license (DBAD)  

\* Comment guidelines:
comments work as follows:
```
Always use a comment block

/*
* your name or handle or any way you would like to identify yourself, or skip it
*
* two lines of description 
* for what the css does
* 
* https://a maximum of 3 links.com
* https://to show examples and usage.io
* https://codepen examples are encouraged.net
*/
```

Shameless self promotion is allowed, just don't be annoying about it - so feel free to add a link to your site/twitter/fb/whatever but it counts as one of your links

I will check links - DON'T LINK TO HARMFUL OR STUPID* CONTENT
(\* stupid can mean anything I want it to)

Stupid DOES NOT include sites like ```www.lingscars.com``` - this is perfectly reasonable

If you are an original creator of an example on this repository and wish to be credited for your work, or for your work 
to be removed, please contact me via the issues channel on github and I will resolve the issue.
